# Predicting Heart Disease Using Machine Learning

## Overview
This project uses Python and machine learning techniques to develop a predictive model for diagnosing heart disease based on clinical features. It demonstrates the use of exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and model evaluation to achieve high prediction accuracy.

## Features
- **Data Source**: UCI Machine Learning Repository and Kaggle datasets.
- **Libraries Used**: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn.
- **Target Accuracy**: Achieve 95% accuracy in heart disease predictions.

## Approach
1. Problem Definition: Can we predict whether a patient has heart disease using their medical attributes?
2. Data Collection: Processed clinical data including attributes like age, chest pain type, cholesterol, and more.
3. Modeling: Tested multiple models (Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, Random Forest) and optimized them through cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning.
4. Evaluation: Evaluated models using precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC curves.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the necessary dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`.
3. Run the notebook `end-to-end-heart-disease-classification.ipynb` to reproduce the analysis.

## Results
- Developed a model achieving high accuracy in predicting heart disease.
- Insights derived from the data can inform clinical decision-making processes.
